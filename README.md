# NetworkAutomata
A Java-based puzzle game that will be later incorporated into a larger puzzle game.

Gameplay is based on Conway's Game of Life, crossed with neural network structures.

The player takes the role of a network attacker, and must activate the error bit of a program's 5-bit output to win.
